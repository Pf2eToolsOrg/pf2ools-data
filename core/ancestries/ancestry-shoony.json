						"Your ancestors were famous trackers, and you carry in your blood that same gift of the hunt. You gain a special sense: imprecise {@ability scent} with a range of 30 feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to determine the location of a creature, but it remains hidden. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to {@skill Survival} checks to {@action Track} creatures that you have previously sensed with your {@ability scent}."

If you roll a success on an attempt to {@action Grab an Edge}, you get a critical success instead; if you roll a critical failure, you get a failure instead. A creature that rolls a failure on a check to {@action Disarm} you gets a critical failure instead."

						"You are a rare shoony who hails from colder climes. You gain cold resistance equal to half your level (minimum 1), and you treat environmental cold effects as if they were one step less extreme (incredible cold becomes extreme, extreme cold becomes severe, and so on). You don't need to succeed at a flat check to target a {@condition concealed} creature if that creature is concealed only by snow. Unless you wear protective gear or take shelter, environmental heat effects are one step more extreme for you."
