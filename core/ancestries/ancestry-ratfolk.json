In addition, environmental heat effects are one step less extreme for you, and you can go 10 times as long as normal before you are affected by starvation or thirst. However, unless you wear protective gear or take shelter, environmental cold effects are one step more extreme for you."

The GM will usually double the range if you're downwind from the creature or halve the range if you're upwind.",

When you {@action Demoralize} an animal, you don't take a penalty for not sharing a language with it. If you would automatically become trained in {@skill Intimidation} (from your background or class, for example), you become trained in another skill of your choice.",
