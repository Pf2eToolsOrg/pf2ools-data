						"While you are an amphibious being equally as capable on land as in the water, your body requires you to return to aquatic environments at least once in a 24-hour period. You must submerge in water in order to rehydrate your water-acclimated skin. If you fail to do this, your skin begins to crack and your gills become painful. After the first 24 hours outside of water, you take a \u20131 status penalty to Fortitude saves. After 48 hours, you struggle to breathe air and begin to suffocate until returned to water."

You gain {@ability darkvision}. Your body is dotted with phosphorescent spots that emit a guiding light and help you communicate. The spots\u2014located primarily on your face, arms, and hands\u2014illuminate a 10-foot radius around you with dim light. You can activate, deactivate, or change the arrangement of lights as an action, which has the {@trait concentrate|concentration} trait."

You no longer need to be immersed in water every 24 hours to maintain your skin and can instead mist or wipe your skin with water to live comfortably. Your land Speed is 25 feet, but your swim Speed is only 15 feet."
