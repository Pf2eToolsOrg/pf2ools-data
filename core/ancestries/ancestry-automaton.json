Additionally, you are not destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points. Instead, your life energy attempts to keep you active even in dire straits; you are knocked out and begin {@condition dying} when reduced to 0 Hit Points (Core Rulebook 459)."

During this period of rest, you must enter a recuperating standby state for 2 hours, which is similar to sleeping except you are aware of your surroundings and don't take penalties for being {@condition unconscious}. Much like with sleeping, if you go too long without entering your standby state, you become {@condition fatigued} and can't recover until you enter standby for 2 hours."
