Additionally, you can force fragments of your shadow to glow and cast {@spell dancing lights} and {@spell light} as occult innate cantrips. Cantrips are heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up."

You're Small instead of Medium. You gain the trained proficiency rank in {@skill Acrobatics}, the {@feat Quick Squeeze} skill feat, and a +1 circumstance bonus to {@skill Acrobatics} checks to {@action Tumble Through}. If you would automatically become trained in {@skill Acrobatics} (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice."
