						"You have the form of a child's tiny toy or doll, but you don't let your small size impede your joy of life. Instead of {@trait Small}, your size is {@trait Tiny}. Like other {@trait Tiny} creatures, you don't automatically receive lesser cover from being in a larger creature's space, but circumstances might allow you to {@action Take Cover}. You can purchase weapons, armor, and other items for your size with the same statistics as normal gear, except that melee weapons have a reach of 0 for you (or a {@trait reach <5 feet>} shorter than normal if they have the {@trait reach} trait). You can enter another creature's space, which is important because you must usually enter a creature's space to attack it with melee {@action Strike||Strikes}! {@quickref Remember to adjust the Bulk of items and your Bulk limit for Tiny size||1|Items and Sizes}. The information on how to handle {@trait Tiny} PCs, including rules for attempting to ride on other characters, appears on page 66 of the Pathfinder Lost Omens Ancestry Guide."

You must still breathe to ventilate your internal mechanisms and sleep to give your mechanisms rest, just like other poppets."
